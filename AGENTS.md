## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking. Do NOT use markdown TODOs, task lists, or other tracking methods.

### Why bd?

- Dependency-aware: Track blockers and relationships between issues
- Git-friendly: Auto-syncs to JSONL for version control
- Agent-optimized: JSON output, ready work detection, discovered-from links
- Prevents duplicate tracking systems and confusion

### Quick Start

**Check for ready work:**

```bash
bd ready --json
```

**Create new issues:**

```bash
bd create "Issue title" --description="Detailed context" -t bug|feature|task -p 0-4 --json
bd create "Issue title" --description="What this issue is about" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:bd-123 --json
```

**Claim and update:**

```bash
bd update bd-42 --status in_progress --json
bd update bd-42 --priority 1 --json
```

**Complete work:**

```bash
bd close bd-42 --reason "Completed" --json
```

### Issue Types

- `bug` - Something broken
- `feature` - New functionality
- `task` - Work item (tests, docs, refactoring)
- `epic` - Large feature with subtasks
- `chore` - Maintenance (dependencies, tooling)

### Priorities

- `0` - Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)
- `1` - High (major features, important bugs)
- `2` - Medium (default, nice-to-have)
- `3` - Low (polish, optimization)
- `4` - Backlog (future ideas)

### Workflow for AI Agents

1. **Check ready work**: `bd ready` shows unblocked issues
2. **Claim your task**: `bd update <id> --status in_progress`
3. **Work on it**: Implement, test, document
4. **Discover new work?** Create linked issue:
   - `bd create "Found bug" --description="Details about what was found" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:<parent-id>`
5. **Complete**: `bd close <id> --reason "Done"`

### Auto-Sync

bd automatically syncs with git:

- Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)
- Imports from JSONL when newer (e.g., after `git pull`)
- No manual export/import needed!

### Important Rules

- ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking
- ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use
- ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies
- ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking "what should I work on?"
- ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists
- ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers
- ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems

## Git and Version Management

- Work must always be committed after finishing a beads issue.
- Commits must always follow the Conventional Commits specification.
- After finishing all work, check if a .beads/issues.jsonl change is still pending. If it is commit it with "chore(beads): sync issue tracker".
- After everything is committed, push it to the remote (oneshot, if any errors still pop up ask the user).

## Testing

- **TDD must be used** - Write tests before implementation code
- **Quality over quantity** - Fewer meaningful tests that cover real behaviour are better than many shallow tests
- **One test at a time** - Write one failing test, make it pass, refactor, then write the next. Do not generate an entire test suite up front
- **Confirm the test fails first** - Run each new test and verify it fails for the expected reason before writing any implementation. This catches phantom tests that pass trivially
- **Test behaviour, not implementation** - Assert against observable outputs, return values, and side effects. Never assert on internal state or private methods. Tests that break on refactor (without behaviour change) are wrong
- **Run the full suite after every change** - Not just the new test. AI refactoring frequently breaks existing functionality
- **Never modify tests to make them pass** - Fix the implementation, not the test. Never delete, skip, comment out, or weaken assertions. Never add `@pytest.mark.skip`, `@ts-expect-error`, `# type: ignore`, or similar suppressions to silence failures
- **Don't over-implement** - If the test passes, the implementation is done. Do not add code that is not required by a failing test
- **E2E with Docker** - Run docker compose up when kicking off Playwright tests, shutdown when finished.

## Dependency Management

### Ask First
- **Never install, upgrade, or remove a package without explicit user approval.** State the package name, version, and why it is needed
- **Never use `--force` or `--legacy-peer-deps`** (or Bun equivalents) to bypass dependency conflicts. Report the conflict and ask for guidance

### Before Proposing a New Dependency
- **Verify the package exists** on the official registry and has a real repository with meaningful history and downloads. LLMs hallucinate package names (~20% of AI-suggested packages don't exist), and attackers register these names with malicious payloads (slopsquatting)
- **Check whether the functionality already exists** in the language stdlib, Web APIs, or a dependency the project already has. Do not add packages for things like URL parsing (`new URL()`), deep cloning (`structuredClone()`), or other built-ins
- **Check whether the package is deprecated or superseded.** Do not suggest packages from training data that have been replaced (e.g. `moment` -> `date-fns`, `request` -> `fetch`)

### Version Discipline
- **Always specify an explicit version** when installing (e.g. `bun add foo@3.2.1`), never bare `bun add foo`
- **Match the version range style** already used in package.json (exact, caret, tilde). Do not mix conventions
- **Never upgrade a major version as a side-effect** of another change. Major upgrades are their own task/PR

### Lock Files
- **Never manually edit lock files** (`bun.lock`). They must only be modified by running the package manager
- To resolve lock file conflicts: accept one side, delete the lock file, re-run `bun install`, and commit the result
- Always commit lock file changes alongside package.json changes

### Removal
- Before removing a dependency, **search the entire codebase** for all imports, requires, and dynamic references to it
- Check that no other package depends on it as a peer dependency
